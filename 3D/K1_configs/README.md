  I created this repo becuase I had a hard time finding a good starting point for my printer after I made a few hardware changes.
I added the following
    Ender 3 Pro
    Micro-swiss NG Direct Drive
    Dual Z-axis 
    PEI Build Plate

  I also configured the max range of the default build area when updating the z-offset. I also made what I believe to be
a decent initial configuration for the extruder and rotation_distance

I did the full math and working well. Maybe some adjustments to the bed if anything.
